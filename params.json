  "body": "# Becoming a Better Data Communicator: Stata Data Visualization\r\nThis repository contains materials for the _Becoming a Better Data Communicator: Stata Data Visualization_ session at the [Strategic Data Project's 2016 Spring Convening](http://sdp.cepr.harvard.edu/event/beyond-numbers-convening).  Additionally, if there are resources you think others may find helpful, please feel free to share them here as well via `pull` requests.  \r\n\r\n# Prereadings\r\n[brewscheme](http://wbuchanan.github.io/brewscheme/brewscheme.pdf) \r\n\r\n# Prework\r\nPrior to attending the session, participants should install the `brewscheme` package; the `jsonio` package is optional, but will be useful if you ever need to work with JSON data or are interested in using [D3js](https://www.d3js.org) from Stata.  To make sure you have the most recent version of the program you can install it using:\r\n\r\n```Stata\r\nnet install brewscheme, from(\"http://wbuchanan.github.io/brewscheme/\")\r\nnet install jsonio, from(\"http://wbuchanan.github.io/StataJSON/\")\r\n```\r\n\r\n# Data used for graph examples - Mississippi Statewide Accountability System Results\r\nSince these data are already vetted and contain variables from each of the measurement scales, this would be a good data set to work with for examples.  \r\n\r\nThere is a Stata executable `msas.ado` in the exampleCode subdirectory.  I'll \r\ncreate a Stata package that can be installed as well, but you can download/copy \r\nthat file then use:\r\n\r\n```Stata\r\nadopath ++ /Where/You/Saved/msas.ado\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo be able to the program from Stata.  It will download a copy of the data mentioned above and has options to save pre-cleaned Stata formatted files or to load/clean the file from disk:\r\n\r\n## msas.ado Examples\r\n\r\n```Stata\r\n// Download the data and save copies of the performance and participation data to disk\r\nmsas, perf(exdata/performance.dta) partic(exdata/participation.dta) dlf(msas.xlsx)\r\n\r\n// Can load the Stata file normally, or you can load it by processing the MS Excel file\r\n// This would load the performance (e.g., assessment and graduation rate) data\r\nmsas using msas.xlsx, perf\r\n\r\n// This would load the participation rate data\r\nmsas using msas.xlsx, partic\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
